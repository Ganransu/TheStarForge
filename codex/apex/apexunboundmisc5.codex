"Today should be remember as a grand one.

The science team, together with Starvia, managed to link the rift with another world. This is quite the achievement by itself, but we didn't stop there! We sent someone through the rift, to see if we were allowed to cross the worlds. Everything went fine, for a few minutes at least.",

"Scientist Jeremy sadly lost his life 13 minutes after crossing the rift. The cause is unclear, as we cannot send or receive information between the worlds. All we know is that the cable attached to him was severed. To our surprise, little creatures crossed the rift the next day, by coincidence it seems. This meant that when opening a rift, we are opening a door to both sides, not only ours to theirs.",

"Those creatures, Pyreapers we named them, are completely fine outside of their world. This would mean that one's existence is not tied to a single world, and that we might be able to travel safely. We already started to experiment with their highly volatile body, which would be useful to improve our Thermite designs.",

"Starvia is currently developing a suit that would guarantee the wearer's safety when crossing rifts. The technology is still highly unstable, but we are making good progress. If we can't find the Godforge, or if it doesn't even exist, maybe we could find redemption there?"
