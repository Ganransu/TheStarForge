"Status update to all VANGUARD units.

VANGUARD leader Silmar gave us our new primary targets. You shall direct your assigned squads towards the new coordinates marked on your star map. Current top priority is :
- Resource gathering, this concerns ores, essence, and other valuables. The Starforges are going strong, and we need all the resources we can get our hands on. Where you get them from is of little concern.
Glory to the Unbound."
