"Development progress regarding the \"Centurion\" Heavy Tank. 
The first prototypes are completed and ready to operate on the field. We made a few adjustements on the caterpillars, making them more resistant to damage as well as changing the power distribution on the energy core. Their combat effectiveness is very impressive.",
"With these changes, the main weaknesses of the Centurion are no more. We tested it against both vehicles & infantry, and the Centurion proved to be extremely effective. After listening to suggestions from the Heavy Division, we loaded the vehicle with Thermite rockets and shells, our goal here is to melt the armoring of other vehicles.",
"With this, the Centurion is a vehicle to be feared. Starvia is done with the manufacturing process, soon we will be able to face off even stronger opponents. Glory to the Unbound."
